<h1>Japan 2025</h1>
<h2>9/30 - 10/14</h2>

  <p>
    <em>Our plan this trip was to explore <b>Hokkaido</b>. We will fly into <b>Tokyo</b> and stay a few nights, then fly into <b>Hakodate</b>, rent a car
    and drive north to <b>Niseko</b> (day trip to Lake Toya), then drive to <b>Sapporo</b> along the coast (stop by Cape Kamui and Otaru),
    and finally fly back to <b>Tokyo</b> for a few days before flying home.</em>

    <summary>Tokyo and Kichijoji</summary>

    <p class="intro">After landing, we were immediately overstimulated with the sheer amount of shit happening in Tokyo. I have been looking forward to this 
      trip for such a long time, and was immediately having doubts like “oh no, is this how my vacation is going to be the whole time”.
    </p>

      The plan was to go to Harajuku and buy some shoes for the trip, but after stumbling through some tourist packed areas and people 
      watching luxury shopping, we were both kinda just disgusted with the consumeristic nature of humans. Hungry and tired, we just left 
      without getting anything.

    Bella found us a curry place. I was so nervous to go in, but they were really friendly when we entered, and the ordering machine
    was really easy to use.

  <p class="intro">
    The next day we went to Kichijoji, a city west of Tokyo, and finally we were relieved because this was the Japan we were looking forward to:
     quiet parks, local restaurants, cute neighborhoods, fun shopping, and just a sense of community.

  <p class="caption">Got some delicious onigiri from this shop. Even though konbini onigiri is good, it's so much better from a dedicated shop</p>

  <p>Then we went to Inokashira Park and ate our onigiri there. (fun fact: this is where I took my first date in Persona 5)</p>

  <p>As we walked towards one end of the park and started encroaching onto the residential neighborhoods, we stopped by a konbini and got a pear sando.</p>

  <p>We hiked across some neighborhoods to get to the other end of the park. On the other side of the park, there were many sports activities and fields,
    a bustling community. There was also a Studio Ghibli museum, but we didn't go since we didn't book tickets in advance.</p>
