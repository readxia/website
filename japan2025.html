<h1>Japan 2025</h1>
<h2>9/30 - 10/14</h2>

  <p>
    <em>Our plan this trip was to explore <b>Hokkaido</b>. We will fly into <b>Tokyo</b> and stay a few nights, then fly into <b>Hakodate</b>, rent a car
    and drive north to <b>Niseko</b> (day trip to Lake Toya), then drive to <b>Sapporo</b> along the coast (stop by Cape Kamui and Otaru),
    and finally fly back to <b>Tokyo</b> for a few days before flying home.</em>

    <summary>Tokyo and Kichijoji</summary>

    <p class="intro">After landing, we were immediately overstimulated with the sheer amount of shit happening in Tokyo. I have been looking forward to this 
      trip for such a long time, and was immediately having doubts like “oh no, is this how my vacation is going to be the whole time”.
    </p>

    <p class="caption">Fuck this street, I never want to come here again</p>

    <p>
      The plan was to go to Harajuku and buy some Onitsuka's for the trip, but after stumbling through some tourist packed areas and people 
      watched (Chinese) people shop luxury goods, we were both kinda just disgusted with the consumerism of tourists (I would never). Hungry and tired, we just left 
      without getting anything. 
    </p>

  <img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/XZKNCqhG/takeshita2.webp" alt="takeshita2">
  <p class="caption">Nonetheless, a nice wet day</p>



  <p>
    Bella found us a curry place. I was so nervous to go in, but they were really friendly when we entered, and the ordering machine
    was really easy to use.

  <p class="intro">
    The next day we went to Kichijoji, a city west of Tokyo, and finally we were relieved because this was the Japan we were looking forward to:
     quiet parks, local restaurants, cute neighborhoods, fun shopping, and just a sense of community.

  <p class="caption">Got some delicious onigiri from this shop. Even though konbini onigiri is good, it's so much better from a dedicated shop</p>

  <p>Then we went to Inokashira Park and ate our onigiri there. (fun fact: this is where I took my first date in Persona 5)</p>

  <p>As we walked towards one end of the park and started encroaching onto the residential neighborhoods, we stopped by a konbini and got a pear sando.</p>

  <p>We hiked across some neighborhoods to get to the other end of the park. On the other side of the park, there were many recreational fields and
    a bustling community. There was also a Studio Ghibli museum, but we didn't go since we didn't book tickets in advance.</p>
  <img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/HfgWXbDw/residentialstreets.webp" alt="residentialstreets">
  <p class="caption">Though it wasn't empty, the neighborhoods were so quiet. We heard a lady gently pulling on her shiba, telling him "ikuzo! ikuzo!"</p>

  <p class="caption">A park map near the Ghibli museum and sports fields. We started at the lake, followed the lake off the left side of the map, 
    walked around some residential areas and entered the park again at the top of the map. The zoo wasn't open this early in the morning, though I 
    doubt we would have gone anyways</p>
  <p>Starting to get hungry, we then walked back toward the station as shops began to open up. We went to Sunroad Shopping Arcade and other various malls. 
    Here I bought a used lens for my camera (which I actually later regretted). This was the kind of shopping we enjoyed the most. Nothing crazy, low crowds,
    just a unique blend of local shops and chain stores. </p>

    , and Bella got this really nice coat exclusive to Japan.</p>
  <p>Other than that, not pictured, we went to Akihabara to get some ARTISAN TYPE-99 mousepads (Matcha, the best one). Though, Bella was definitely culture shocked seeing all those
    girls on the street dressed up as male fantasies trying to get customers in their cafes. As much as she loves anime, I don't think we'll ever come back to Akihabara.</p>

    <h2>10/3 - 10/4</h2>
  <details class="day" id="Hakodate">
    <summary>Hakodate</summary>
    <p class="intro">Early morning, we flew into the dreamy city of Hakodate. A coastal city that was very chill and quiet, filled with charm
      and beautiful views. Here we noticed that we saw a lot more elderly people than we did in Tokyo, and everyone seemed more relaxed and laid back,
      and most importantly, ZERO depressing salarymen. A city where we first regretted booking two nights at, became one of our favorite stops on the trip.
    </p>
    <p>We woke up early and took the first train to the airport for our 7am flight to Hakodate. </p>
    <img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/8nLWT5KM/tamachistation.webp" alt="tamachistation">
    <p class="caption">Waiting for the first train</p> 

    <p>
      Flying AirDo, we were lucky to have a Rokon Jet which was Pokemon themed! Did some research and apparently it's a collaboration that was cancelled in 2016, 
      but then revived in 2021. So our plane was decorated in Vulpixes (and some ice looking Vulpixes that I've never seen), and even the flight attendants wore cute Pokemon
      themed aprons.

    <p class="caption">Bella's first famichiki, she ate 3 more the same day</p>

    <p>After dropping off our luggage, we took the tram to the Hakodate Morning Market, where they served a bunch of fresh seafood, fruits, desserts, and more. 
      We ended up only trying some ice cream and some fruits (A big juicy peach and japanese muscat grapes)</p>

    <p>We then walked toward the bay, where we had views of Mt. Hakodate as well as the sea. The weather was wonderful. Imagine SF but without 100mph winds that penetrate your bones.
      The water was so calm, the sky was so clear, and the best part: no crowds. Just me and Bella. A quality of Hokkaido which really made our trip special, and also something I will
      continue to mention in different parts of this page. Hokkaido really was a feast for the senses.

    <p class="caption">This is what the photos looked like without editing. It's a shame, I really liked this photo of the man on his bike taking in the view</p>

    <p>We then walked to the Kanemori Red Brick Warehouses, a collection of old warehouses that were repurposed to a shopping area along the coast. Here, we did a bunch of gift shopping where 
      Bella had a blast going through every little store (My camera also died here, but here we had our first taste of Hokkaido dairy with some cheesecake, parfaits, and flans).

    <p class="caption">A really nice Starbucks with a back balcony with a view of the bay. We got some kind of yuzu tea drink that was delicious.</p>

    <p>Tired, we went back to the hotel to rest up (and get an extra battery), and then walked to Fort Goryokaku Tower where we planned to watch the sunset.</p>
    <img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/gKNXWJm/mirrorselfie.webp" alt="mirrorselfie">
    <p class="caption">The only photo of me you'll probably see on this trip</p>

    <p class="caption">The walk from our hotel to Fort Goryokaku Tower</p>

    <p>The tower had amazing views of the city, the bay, and the mountains. Hakodate is surrounded by these layers of green hills and mountains, and the other side is the sea.
      Since there weren't really any tall buildings, you can see how far the city extends and we're not even that high up. It was difficult to capture how immersive the scene was, just a
      360 view of a peaceful city surrounded by nature.

      remaining shogunate forces and the new Meiji government in 1869 (We learned this from the tower's museum). We will visit here tomorrow
    </p>

    <p>We ended the night with some Shio ramen (salt), a Hakodate specialty. I like lighter tasting ramens, so I really enjoyed it</p>
    <img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/hJz2kQJm/shioramenshop.webp" alt="shioramenshop">

    <p class="caption">Some random shop on our way back</p>

    <p>Next morning, we took the tram to a cafe near the red brick warehouses. If we were to ever come back to Hakodate, I would definitely book a hotel closer to the bay, because the tram, 
      although cute, is kinda slow and infrequent. Anyways I'm just spoiled. At the cafe, I got a matcha and Bella got a coffee. The cafe seemed to be like a traditional japanese home with a 
      garden in the center of it, remodeled to have a cafe in the front.

    <p>Then we walked up Hachiman-zaka slope. Halfway, we ordered at another coffee shop where Bella got an espresso + sparkling water. She hated it.</p>

    <p class="caption">The view from the top of the slope</p>

    <p>On top of the slope, we walked towards the Motomachi district, a European inspired district where the former British Consulate of Hakodate is located. 
      Here we saw a group of foreigners doing a guided tour. As they were walking by, I asked one of the guys where they were from. <br> <br>
      <em>"Atlanta!" <br>
      "Oh nice, we're from Texas!" <br>
      He looked at me with the most confused expression. <br>
      "YOU'RE from Texas?!" <br>
      "Yup!" <br>
      "Wow... where in Texas?" <br>
      "Austin!" <br>
      "Wow... well have a nice day." <br><br></em>
      Who would've thought the only microaggression I'd encounter on this trip would come from a white guy.

    <p>Then we walked to another cafe on the slope. This cafe was super cozy and had some really delicious food. This girl was sitting on sewing machine table (with the pedals and everything) 
      just facing the wall. It was so quiet I was scared to take photos because my shutter was that loud.

    <p class="caption">We saw a lot of hydrangeas, though I think they were going out of season</p>

    <p>After filling up, we went took a 10 min taxi to Cape Tachimachi, and it was beautiful. Again, very little wind, super quiet, no sounds of waves or people, just a beautiful view
      of the cliffs and the city along the coast. The day was so clear that in the distance, you can make out the main island of Japan.

    <p>We then went back to explore the garden of Fort Goryokaku. Remember that tower?</p>

    <p class="caption">We walked along the "star" path of the garden</p>

    <p>Then finally, we headed back towards Mt. Hakodate and took the gondola up the mointain to enjoy night views of the city. Again, just endless views of both coastlines of Hakodate, 
      and the silhouettes of the mountains in the distance. I also noticed a lighthouse at the end of the eastern coast that was flashing its light every few seconds. Though it was packed, 
      and full of pushy tourists, it was still a nice end to our Hakodate trip.
