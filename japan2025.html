<h1>Japan 2025</h1>
<h2>9/30 - 10/14</h2>

  <p>
    <em>Our plan this trip was to explore <b>Hokkaido</b>. We will fly into <b>Tokyo</b> and stay a few nights, then fly into <b>Hakodate</b>, rent a car
    and drive north to <b>Niseko</b> (day trip to Lake Toya), then drive to <b>Sapporo</b> along the coast (stop by Cape Kamui and Otaru),
    and finally fly back to <b>Tokyo</b> for a few days before flying home.</em>

    <summary>Tokyo and Kichijoji</summary>

    <p class="intro">After landing, we were immediately overstimulated with the sheer amount of shit happening in Tokyo. I have been looking forward to this 
      trip for such a long time, and was immediately having doubts like “oh no, is this how my vacation is going to be the whole time”.
    </p>

    <p class="caption">Fuck this street, I never want to come here again</p>

    <p>
      The plan was to go to Harajuku and buy some Onitsuka's for the trip, but after stumbling through some tourist packed areas and people 
      watched (Chinese) people shop luxury goods, we were both kinda just disgusted with the consumerism of tourists (I would never). Hungry and tired, we just left 
      without getting anything. 
    </p>

  <p class="caption">Nonetheless, a nice wet day</p>



  <p>
    Bella found us a curry place. I was so nervous to go in, but they were really friendly when we entered, and the ordering machine
    was really easy to use.

  <p class="intro">
    The next day we went to Kichijoji, a city west of Tokyo, and finally we were relieved because this was the Japan we were looking forward to:
     quiet parks, local restaurants, cute neighborhoods, fun shopping, and just a sense of community.

  <p class="caption">Got some delicious onigiri from this shop. Even though konbini onigiri is good, it's so much better from a dedicated shop</p>

  <p>Then we went to Inokashira Park and ate our onigiri there. (fun fact: this is where I took my first date in Persona 5)</p>

  <p>As we walked towards one end of the park and started encroaching onto the residential neighborhoods, we stopped by a konbini and got a pear sando.</p>

  <p>We hiked across some neighborhoods to get to the other end of the park. On the other side of the park, there were many recreational fields and
    a bustling community. There was also a Studio Ghibli museum, but we didn't go since we didn't book tickets in advance.</p>
  <img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/HfgWXbDw/residentialstreets.webp" alt="residentialstreets">

    walked around some residential areas and entered the park again at the top of the map. The zoo wasn't open this early in the morning, though I 
    doubt we would have gone anyways</p>
  <p>Starting to get hungry, we then walked back toward the station as shops began to open up. We went to Sunroad Shopping Arcade and other various malls. 
    Here I bought a used lens for my camera (which I actually later regretted). This was the kind of shopping we enjoyed the most. Nothing crazy, low crowds,
    just a unique blend of local shops and chain stores. </p>

    , and Bella got this really nice coat exclusive to Japan.</p>
  <p>Other than that, not pictured, we went to Akihabara to get some ARTISAN TYPE-99 mousepads (Matcha, the best one). Though, Bella was definitely culture shocked seeing all those
    girls on the street dressed up as male fantasies trying to get customers in their cafes. As much as she loves anime, I don't think we'll ever come back to Akihabara.</p>

  <h2>10/3 - 10/4</h2>
  <details class="day" id="Hakodate">
    <summary>Hakodate</summary>
    <p class="intro">Early morning, we flew into the dreamy city of Hakodate. A coastal city that was very chill and quiet, filled with charm
      and beautiful views. Here we noticed that we saw a lot more elderly people than we did in Tokyo, and everyone seemed more relaxed and laid back,
      and most importantly, ZERO depressing salarymen. A city where we first regretted booking two nights at, became one of our favorite stops on the trip.
    </p>
    <p>We woke up early and took the first train to the airport for our 7am flight to Hakodate. </p>
    <img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/8nLWT5KM/tamachistation.webp" alt="tamachistation">
    <p class="caption">Waiting for the first train</p> 

    <p>
      Flying AirDo, we were lucky to have a Rokon Jet which was Pokemon themed! Did some research and apparently it's a collaboration that was cancelled in 2016, 
      but then revived in 2021. So our plane was decorated in Vulpixes (and some ice looking Vulpixes that I've never seen), and even the flight attendants wore cute Pokemon
      themed aprons.

    <p class="caption">Bella's first famichiki, she ate 3 more the same day</p>

    <p>After dropping off our luggage, we took the tram to the Hakodate Morning Market, where they served a bunch of fresh seafood, fruits, desserts, and more. 
      We ended up only trying some ice cream and some fruits (A big juicy peach and japanese muscat grapes)</p>

    <p>We then walked toward the bay, where we had views of Mt. Hakodate as well as the sea. The weather was wonderful. Imagine SF but without 100mph winds that penetrate your bones.
      The water was so calm, the sky was so clear, and the best part: no crowds. Just me and Bella. A quality of Hokkaido which really made our trip special, and also something I will
      continue to mention in different parts of this page. Hokkaido really was a feast for the senses.

    <p class="caption">This is what the photos looked like without editing. It's a shame, I really liked this photo of the man on his bike taking in the view</p>

    <p>We then walked to the Kanemori Red Brick Warehouses, a collection of old warehouses that were repurposed to a shopping area along the coast. Here, we did a bunch of gift shopping where 
      Bella had a blast going through every little store (My camera also died here, but here we had our first taste of Hokkaido dairy with some cheesecake, parfaits, and flans).

    <p class="caption">A really nice Starbucks with a back balcony with a view of the bay. We got some kind of yuzu tea drink that was delicious.</p>

    <p>Tired, we went back to the hotel to rest up (and get an extra battery), and then walked to Fort Goryokaku Tower where we planned to watch the sunset.</p>
    <img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/gKNXWJm/mirrorselfie.webp" alt="mirrorselfie">
    <p class="caption">The only photo of me you'll probably see on this trip</p>

    <p class="caption">The walk from our hotel to Fort Goryokaku Tower</p>

    <p>The tower had amazing views of the city, the bay, and the mountains. Hakodate is surrounded by these layers of green hills and mountains, and the other side is the sea.
      Since there weren't really any tall buildings, you can see how far the city extends and we're not even that high up. It was difficult to capture how immersive the scene was, just a
      360 view of a peaceful city surrounded by nature.

      remaining shogunate forces and the new Meiji government in 1869 (We learned this from the tower's museum). We will visit here tomorrow
    </p>

    <p>We ended the night with some Shio ramen (salt), a Hakodate specialty. I like lighter tasting ramens, so I really enjoyed it</p>
    <img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/hJz2kQJm/shioramenshop.webp" alt="shioramenshop">

    <p class="caption">Some random shop on our way back</p>

    <p>Next morning, we took the tram to a cafe near the red brick warehouses. If we were to ever come back to Hakodate, I would definitely book a hotel closer to the bay, because the tram, 
      although cute, is kinda slow and infrequent. Anyways I'm just spoiled. At the cafe, I got a matcha and Bella got a coffee. The cafe seemed to be like a traditional japanese home with a 
      garden in the center of it, remodeled to have a cafe in the front.

    <p>Then we walked up Hachiman-zaka slope. Halfway, we ordered at another coffee shop where Bella got an espresso + sparkling water. She hated it.</p>

    <p class="caption">The view from the top of the slope</p>

    <p>On top of the slope, we walked towards the Motomachi district, a European inspired district where the former British Consulate of Hakodate is located. 
      Here we saw a group of foreigners doing a guided tour. As they were walking by, I asked one of the guys where they were from. <br> <br>
      <em>"Atlanta!" <br>
      "Oh nice, we're from Texas!" <br>
      He looked at me with the most confused expression. <br>
      "<b>YOU'RE</b> from Texas?!" <br>
      "Yup!" <br>
      "Wow... where in Texas?" <br>
      "Austin!" <br>
      "Wow... well have a nice day." <br><br></em>
      Who would've thought the only microaggression I'd encounter on this trip would come from a white guy.

    <p>Then we walked to another cafe on the slope. This cafe was super cozy and had some really delicious food. This girl was sitting on sewing machine table (with the pedals and everything) 
      just facing the wall. It was so quiet I was scared to take photos because my shutter was that loud.

    <p class="caption">We saw a lot of hydrangeas, though I think they were going out of season</p>

    <p>After filling up, we went took a 10 min taxi to Cape Tachimachi, and it was beautiful. Again, very little wind, super quiet, no sounds of waves or people, just a beautiful view
      of the cliffs and the city along the coast. The day was so clear that in the distance, you can make out the main island of Japan.

    <p>We then went back to explore the garden of Fort Goryokaku. Remember that tower?</p>

    <p>Then finally, we headed back towards Mt. Hakodate and took the gondola up the mointain to enjoy night views of the city. Again, just endless views of both coastlines of Hakodate, 
      and the silhouettes of the mountains in the distance. I also noticed a lighthouse at the end of the eastern coast that was flashing its light every few seconds. Though it was packed, 
      and full of pushy tourists, it was still a nice end to our Hakodate trip.

  <h2>10/5 - 10/6</h2>
  <details class="day" id="Niseko">
  <summary>Niseko</summary>

  <p class="intro">From Hakodate, we rented a car and drove to Niseko (more specifically, Hirafu). Hirafu itself is a ski village with lots of resorts for the ski season.
    However, in the off season, we were able to score some cheap rooms at the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at. Though it is known for their powdered snow in the winter, 
    there was so much natural beauty in these smaller towns of Hokkaido. The drive from Hakodate was about 3 hours, and it was loaded with the most scenic drive I've ever taken.
    Rolling green hills, cozy farms and cottages, ocean views, mountains, valleys, rivers, and lakes. It felt like a Studio Ghibli movie. Anytime anyone asks me what my favorite
    part of the trip was, I always say just driving between towns. </p>

  <p>That morning, we ate the amazing hotel breakfast and packed out bags to pick up our car at Toyota Rent-a-Car. Though a bit trippy at first driving on the "left" side of
    the road, after 30 minutes I was already a pro. I only drove in the wrong side of the road twice! If anything, the most annoying part was having the blinker stick on the right
    side of the steering wheel. In intense moments, I always accidentally hit the wipers which made things more hectic! Nonetheless, there wasn't too many drivers on the road
    in general so it was pretty easy. 
  </p>

  <p class="caption">I got a Toyota Yaris. It was like driving a Go-Kart, and the turning radius was insane</p>

  <p>After shitting my pants for the first 30 minutes, I quickly got the hang of driving on the left. So much so that sometimes when I drive my car now, I think about how it feels awkward
    to drive on the right, and use the blinker on the left! Anyways, we took a detour up this viewpoint called Kijihiki Highlands Panorama Observation Deck. This is when the Studio Ghibli
    vibes start to kick in. We had views of Hakodate on one side, a view of these Lakes on another side, and then rolling green hills elsewhere. Again, no wind, no sounds of cars or people
    just pure nature and serenity.

  <p>Also on the way up and down the hill, there were little bumps in the road that would play a tune when you drive over them. I did not recognize either of them, but it was cute. </p>

  <p>We then drove on the highway (tollway) and was bombarded with seaside towns between mountain valleys and beaches. We wanted to check one out, but I think we chose a bad one because
    there wasn't much to see. But we walked to the beach and saw some surfers.
  </p>

  <p class="caption">We didn't stay for long</p>


  <p>After getting off the tollway, we had to drive through a lot of small towns full of farmhouses or residential homes. Seeing all these cute towns, we chose to stop at this 
    town called Kogane, and we walked along this bridge with a river passing through, and we saw this cool Japanese couple hanging out near the water. They looked very friendly
    and greeted us from the bottom of the bridge. In another time of my life, I would have went down there and tried to talk to them, but today was not that day.
  </p>

  <p class="caption">A couple chillin next to the water</p>

  <p>As we walked back to our car, we noticed a rotting stench coming from the river. At the same time, I heard some rustling in the tall grass. Suddenly, we notice that there 
    is a decaying carcass of some racoon looking animal being swarmed with flies. It was unsettling because of how close we were to it and how smelly it was. As Bella turned away 
    from the carcass to retreat to the car, this little fox darted out of the tall grass and onto the street! As it was also probably surprised to see us, it made an evil growl at us
    . Bella and I immediately jumped backwards in shock, and the fox darted away along the road looking uneasy as well with its tail lowered between its legs. Traumatized and our courage debuffed,
    Bella and I anxiously returned to the car. Anyways, enjoy the photos I took right before it happened (No fox photos as I was shitting myself).

  <p class="caption">Moments after snapping this photo, a fox used growl on me</p>

  <p>As we arrived to Hirafu before our hotel check-in, we stopped by a cafe to kill some time. The girls working there all looked like they shredded snow, and that this was probably 
    their offseason job. Definitely the feeling of this town was that it is a ski resort town, where there are many outdoor activities you can book, and high end outdoorsy gear you can buy,
    a lot of stores were just closed for the season. Going back to the cafe food, it was a bit pricier than usual for some average looking food. Though this was my wake up call to how good 
    the food in Hokkaido is about to be. All I did was bite into a tomato they sliced, and I've never enjoyed a tomato so much before. <br><br>

    After our meal, we checked into our hotel, and it was easily the nicest hotel I've ever stayed at. Even though we only booked a standard room, it was spacious, clean, and beautifully designed. 
    They had some freshly baked macrons from their in-house bakery, and they even wrote me a card for my birthday! (Which came with some brownies also from their bakery) Not to mention, we had 
    a front row view of the Lawson's and Mt. Yotei from our room. All for less than $150 a night (an amazing breakfast included), I wish we stayed here longer. <br>
    
    Didn't get that many good photos of the entire room, but here are a few shots I took:

  <p class="caption">The view of Mt. Yotei from our room</p>

  <p>After missing the sunset, we headed to the Niseko Park Hyatt, and walked their Mountain Lights art display. You take the gondola behind the hotel up the mountain, and walk down between 
    the tall trees along an illuminated pathway. Though we couldnt' see much since it was already dark, the walk was incredibly peaceful. It was silent, only the smell of brisk mountain air.</p>

  <img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/jP1QBkLM/mountainlights.webp" alt="mountainlights">
    <p class="caption">All my photos were so blurry because of the lack of light, so this is the best you get qwq</p>

  <p>Then, we ended the night with a yuzu shoyu ramen from the ramen shop attached to the hotel. Though apparently it's a "mid" tier ramen shop, it might have been the best ramen I've ever had.</p>

    <p class="caption">Afuri Ramen. Not pictured was a Chashudon and a yuzu limeade &lt;3 </p>

  <p>Just kidding, we actually ended the night with our private onsen booking with the hotel. Couldn't take photos but just know it was amazing. You can open the window and the fresh mountain air 
    just hit our faces while I was sweating my ass off. It was so nice, we booked it again for tomorrow night. <br><br>
  
    The next day we had breakfast at the hotel with the best japanese breakfast spread ever. All of their ingredients were so nice, I could have just eaten the Hokkaido rice by itself (and I did).
  </p>
    <img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/Hpb3r9y4/breakfast.webp" alt="breakfast">

  <p>This was our day to explore Lake Toya. It was about an hour drive away, and it might have the drive from Hakodate beat. Clear roads with views that looked like Windows wallpapers. There's a 
    charm that I can't quite explain to the farmland here in Hokkaido, but I feel like it has something to do with the feeling of shibui. Unlike America, the land of the american dream, there 
    were no fences saying "HEY! This is MY land, and that is YOUR land! See this fence? Don't touch MY land! If you do, I will SHOOT you!". But here, there is just a common courtesy of
    "I won't encroach on your land because it is your land and I respect you". Plus, there still felt like there was a respect for nature. Their land ended naturally with the curves of the earth, 
    and if it wasn't needed, it was left untouched, given back to mother nature. I'm not sure how to cultivate these feelings, but if you do or would like to discuss, please help. Anyways,
    here's a photo of a pretty big farm we just pulled up next to. 
  </p>

<img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/0yzjkxHR/farm1.webp" alt="farm1">

  <p>As we got to Lake Toya, we navigated to this herbal cafe, and my god, this might have been the coolest place I've ever been. As we pulled in, a golden doodle ran up to our car and followed 
    us while we parked. As we exited the vehicle, the dog scurried away then started barking at us. The owners came out to tell it to shush. The tea shop was in a plot of land with a view of Lake Toya. 
    In front of the shop, there was a garden filled with herbs where you can pick your own herbs, and they make a tea for you out of it.
  </p>

    <p class="caption">Golden doodle followed our car as we parked</p>

  <p>
    The interior of the shop was so cozy and picturesque. It felt like a dream, straight out of a cozy video game. Just a couple of motherly women running a little restaurant for probably
    only a few people a day. Life just felt so simple in this moment. I wish I could be here forever.

  <p>We initially sat on the patio, but it was a little too sunny, so we went inside and ordered a set meal (3 courses). The most memorable meal of the set was the salad. I'm usually not 
    a salad guy, and this salad was very herby (like mint, basil, and dill), but this salad felt so light and crunchy, and the herbal-ness was very fresh and mild. The dressing was so 
    subtle but perfect too, everything just felt so right in that salad.
  </p>

  <p>The photos couldn't encapsulate how serene life felt there. It felt like dining at your asian friend's house, and their asian mom feeds you and treats you with so much motherly love. 
    If you ever go to Lake Toya, I highly recommend you stop here.
  </p>

  <p>After somehow spending an hour and a half at that tea cafe, we headed out towards the town of Toyako Onsen to enjoy lakeside views of Lake Toya. We parked at a park nearby, 
    and walked towards the town along the lake front. It was windy and quite cold, the water was a rich blue, and the island in the middle of the lake looked so plump.

  </p>

    <p class="caption">The fluffy mountains that surrounded the lake</p>

  <p>As we entered the town, we encountered a lot more tourists and tourist buses. Walking around the small town and perusing some of the shops, everything felt pretty touristy and lame.
    The town felt a little dingy as well. No real charm, just big onsen hotels and lame gift shops. My last straw is when I entered a gift shop to look for a bathroom, and it immediately 
    reeked of cigarettes and Chinese people, as well as the shop was filled with landfill garbage. There were many activities we were thinking about doing at Lake Toya, like take the 
    speedboat tour around the lake, or go to Mt. Usu observation deck, but we ended up just leaving. Looking back, I do wish we went to do more scenic activities south of the lake as 
    the view was absolutely stunning.

  <p>On the way back, we stopped by another viewpoint of the lake. It was filled with tourists, but nonetheless, breathtaking.</p>

    <p class="caption">This one was taken with my phone</p>

  <p>We stopped again in a small town called Makkari, which caught our eye on the drive to Lake Toya. This town felt more populous than the other small towns we usually pass through, 
    we even saw a little league baseball game happening near a school. We stopped to admire a little stream that passed through a park. The park was empty, just a little dog barking 
    at us across the stream.

    <p class="caption">Mt. Yotei can be seen everywhere, even at Lake Toya!</p>

  <p>Also seeing this Cheese factory called Niseko Cheese on the way to Lake Toya, we stopped by on the way back. We got a cheese soft serve ice cream, a mochi cheese ball, 
    and a ginger ale (I was thirsty). The ice cream had a nice rich cheese taste, and the mochi cheese ball was just a cheese ball wrapped in mochi. I didn't really enjoy that 
    combo, but Bella liked it. We've noticed a soft drink of choice at restaurants have been ginger ale, and this ginger ale was great. It packed a sharp ginger punch that went to your nose.
    It's low key discouraging my own ginger soda excursions...

  <p>After heading back to our hotel and taking a break, we went to another dairy farm for dinner called Niseko Takahashi Dairy Farm MANDRIANO. We came here to eat their pizza, 
    and didn't realize it was a part of a dairy factory too. It had a beautiful view of Mt. Yotei (just like every place in a 10 mile radius). We ordered a pizza, a salad, and 
    a ginger ale. The salad came out first and it was the best version of a pizza place salad you can ask for. Hearty, but without any meats, so crunchy and the miso dressing 
    was amazing. Then the pizza came out, and it unironically might have been my favorite pizza ever. It was just cheese and bread with some toppings, no sauce. Maybe it's just 
    because of the cheese, but man, cheese in Hokkaido is delicious.

  <h2>10/7 - 10/10</h2>
  <details class="day" id="Sapporo">
  <summary>Sapporo</summary>
  <p class="intro">The next day we planned to road trip to Sapporo, but instead of taking the straight route there, we drove along the western coast to visit Cape Kamui and the port 
    town of Otaru. Again, it was another beautiful day with perfect visibility.
  </p>

  <p>Another beautiful breakfast spread by our hotel. They had mini kaisendons today.</p>

  <p>The drive began again as beautiful farm lands and cute small towns. Once we reached the coast, the scenery changed completely. The drive consisted of tunnels in mountain sides and then 
    open views of the ocean surrounded by green valleys. Absolutely stunning. We stopped at this island that had a shrine on it. The shrine was railed off, I think because of the tides, but 
    it seemed low enough and I was willing to hop it since there was not another human in sight, but Bella said no. The island was in a little cove, and the water was so still.
  </p>

  <img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/ZzQH6DXX/benzei.webp" alt="benzei">

    <p class="caption">Can you find our car?</p>

  <p>As we crossed between tiny coastal towns, we went to another scenic spot where there was a tunnel under the road to get to the shore.</p>

  <img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/YB9tnHWG/tunnel.webp" alt="tunnel">
  <img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/0yQgQnsv/shore.webp" alt="shore">
    <p class="caption">The view of the shore coming from the tunnel</p>

  <p>Since I was doing all the driving, and taking pictures in the car never come out good, this was one of my opportunities to capture what is called Pampas grass or Chinese silver grass. 
    Only blooming in autumn, these were littered everywhere during our drives throughout Hokkaido, and they were my favorite. I feel like these feathery yellow ferns encapsulate the peacefulness 
    Hokkaido has been giving us this whole time, which is something I've been learning to appreciate about life in my past couple of years. Something about the abundance of the grass feels one is 
    embracing the overgrowth of nature and not trying to domesticate it, to see the beauty of change, and to enjoy fleeting moments. I feel like this is explored all over Japan, as where if 
    things are too perfect, it gives one anxiety that one can mess it up, but to flow and embracing the everchanging state of the world, and anxiety disappears. <br> <br>

    To me, these yellow ferns brought a bittersweet comfrot. To let them overgrow. To appreciate how mother nature affects the things we create. To appreciate the fleeting moments of the seasons. 
    Quite opposite to the field of planted flowers in Furano/Biei (spoiler: we planned to but didn't end up going), or the fleets of Chinese tourists yearning for their souvenirs of clout through 
    their cameras. 
  </p>

  <p>Finally, we reached Cape Kamui, and were greeted by fleets of tour buses filled with C****** t*******. Luckily, there was just leaving, so I only had to deal with them spitting in the urinals
    in the bathroom. To get to the view of the cape, you have to climb up this green hill. </p>

  <img class="img-large lightbox-trigger" data-src="https://i.ibb.co/qMmHngLS/capekamuihill.webp" alt="capekamuihill">

  <p>At the top of the hill, you can see the hilly cape with a tiny lighthouse at the tip of it. The entrance of the pathway to the lighthouse was blocked off (not sure why), but the 
    view of the empty trail was nice. 
  </p>

  <p>Although the view of the cape was amazing with the rocky shorts and the perfectly still blue ocean, I couldn't help but enjoy the back view of our viewpoint. Something about the endless 
    layers of green and yellow hills sitting on top of the water.

  <p>We then headed to Otaru, and old port town. We perused Sakaimachi Hondori street, where we entered a bunch of glass shops and tricket stores, and tried a bunch of small street eats. 
    We went to the LeTao flagship store and got a Madeline and a half cheese half milk soft serve. It was so good.
  </p>

  <p>We also tried this fried chicken, and the greatest cucumber of my life (added a bit of salt). It was so crunchy and juicy.</p>

  <p>We also were able to see chum salmon (I learned that from an Outdoor Boys video) attempt to swim up this canal to their deaths, as there were many salmon carcasses in the water.</p>

  <p>We then checked out the Otaru canal, which has now been remodeled as restaurants, cafes, and bars.</p>

  <p>Otaru was a cute town, a bit touristy, but not as cool as we expected it to be. We ended our Otaru visit by going to the LeTao Pathos, which is their cafe. We got a grape cheesecake 
    and this amazing souffle.

  <p>We then headed towards Sapporo. The drive was nothing special, just a 10 dollar tollway being the only road connecting the two cities. And then driving in Sapporo was NOT fun. Rainy, 
    pedestrians at every crosswalk, and rush hour traffic. As we finally made it to our hotel, I went to return the car.
  </p>

  <p>We spent the next couple days exploring Sapporo and shopping. A cold front came through, and we didn't do everything we planned to do since we were getting tired, 
    but here are some interesting pictures and things we did:</p>\

  <p>Some delicious taiwanese food:</p>
  <p>Bella at a gachapon</p>
  <p>Sapporo Susukino Square</p>
  <p>Ramen Yokocho, aka Ramen Alley, the birthplacer of miso ramen. We didn't go to the ramen place we originally wanted to since the line was super long and it was pretty cold, so instead we waited
    in another line that was maybe 10 people waiting for 7 spots in a tiny ramen bar with one person working. The man was so friendly and happy to serve all his customers, and didn't seem stressed 
    at all. A lovely experience on a cold day.

  <p>Mermaid Coffee Roasters. The only place we visited twice. A beautiful shop on Tanukikoji shopping street towards the Nijo Market. They had the friendliest staff that say goodbye when you leave 
    like how asian parents stand outside their home watching you leave. But who cares about that when they had the most amazing matcha latte. The matcha flavor was so good, but holy shit the milk 
    was so rich that it overpowered the lactase pills I brought. We always went upstairs where they had an upper balcony that you had to take off your shoes to enter. Also can't forget about the 
    amazing butter toast with honey, and the cheese toast was crazy too. I don't even remember how the milk bread tasted, just the butter honey combo was heaven in my mouth. Also, we tried this 
    green tea scone that had the most subtle white chocolates. It taste more like cream cheese than pure sugar. If you're ever in Sapporo at Tanukikoji street, you must stop by!

  <p>Nijo Market. We waited in line for Donbe, a restaurant that served kaisendons. Bella isn't too big on raw fish, so she just got a tuna + salmon bowl, where I got a spread of everything. 
    I'm not usually that big on squid or gelatinous creatures in general, but everything in this bowl was so tender and fresh, it was a delight. Though, it was a lot of food to have in the morning.

  <p>Odori Park and Sapporo Tower. We also down the park toward the former Sapporo Court of Appeal. They had a nice garden in front.</p>
  <p>Parfaiteria Pal. We had to experience parfait culture in Sapporo. Parfaiteria Pal was apparently the store that started it all. The vibe of the bar was super cool and cozy, and they made really 
    high end parfaits with a lot of experimentation in their ingredients. It's a shame I'm so bad at taking photos indoors, so the images look awful. I got a Chainsaw Man parfait and Bella got a 
    muscat grape one, which was slightly alcoholic. I kinda agree with Bella that I would have preferred a simpler parfait with like strawberries, cream, and cake (I know their whipped cream would be crazy),
    instead of this fine dining version of a parfait, but it was a really nice experience.
